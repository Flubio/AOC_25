  """Part Two
  The input is a series of instructions for moving around a circular list of 100 positions (0-99).
  Each instruction consists of a direction ('L' for left, 'R' for right) and a number of steps to move in that direction.
  The starting point is 50. The goal is to determine how many times the position 0 is crossed during the execution of all instructions.
  The password is the total number of times position 0 is crossed plus the number of times 0 is reached after execution.
  This method is called 0x434C49434B
